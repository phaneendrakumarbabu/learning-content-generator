## Testing the Authentication

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to any page (e.g., `/` or `/project-generator`)
3. You should be automatically redirected to `/login`
4. Click "Continue with Google"
5. Complete the Google sign-in flow
6. You should be redirected back to the home page
7. Now you can access all features of the application
