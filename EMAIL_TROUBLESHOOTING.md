# Email Link Not Arriving - Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Issue: Email Link Shows "Sent" But Email Not Received

The app shows "Sign-in link sent! Check your email and click the link to sign in" but no email arrives.

## 🔍 Common Causes & Solutions

### 1. **Email Link Provider Not Enabled in Firebase Console**
**Most Common Issue** - The code works but Firebase isn't configured to send emails.

**Solution:**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/tech-innov-48b2c/authentication/providers)
2. Click on **"Email/Password"** provider
3. Make sure **"Email link (passwordless sign-in)"** is **ENABLED** ✅
4. Add **"localhost"** to authorized domains
5. Click **Save**

### 2. **Email Templates Not Configured**
Firebase might not have email templates set up.

**Solution:**
1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Templates
2. Check if "Email link sign-in" template exists
3. If not, Firebase will create it automatically when you enable the provider

### 3. **Spam/Junk Folder**
Firebase emails often go to spam initially.

**Solution:**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Add `noreply@tech-innov-48b2c.firebaseapp.com` to contacts
- Check promotions tab (Gmail)

### 4. **Email Delivery Delays**
Firebase emails can take 1-5 minutes to arrive.

**Solution:**
- Wait 5-10 minutes
- Try a different email address
- Use a Gmail address for testing

### 5. **Domain Authorization Issues**
Localhost might not be properly authorized.

**Solution:**
1. Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
2. Ensure `localhost` is in the list
3. Add `127.0.0.1` as well if needed

### 6. **Firebase Project Quotas**
Free tier has email sending limits.

**Solution:**
- Check Firebase Console → Usage tab
- Upgrade to Blaze plan if needed (pay-as-you-go)

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Verify Firebase Console Setup
1. Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/tech-innov-48b2c/authentication/providers
2. Confirm Email/Password provider shows:
   - ✅ Email/Password: Enabled
   - ✅ Email link (passwordless sign-in): Enabled

### Step 2: Check Authorized Domains
1. Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
2. Should include:
   - `localhost`
   - `tech-innov-48b2c.firebaseapp.com`

### Step 3: Test with Different Email
- Try Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo
- Avoid university/corporate emails (they often block)

### Step 4: Check Browser Console
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for Firebase errors when sending email link

## 🔧 Debug Commands

### Check Firebase Configuration
```javascript
// Run in browser console on localhost:3000
console.log('Firebase Config:', {
  apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
});
```

### Test Email Link Function
```javascript
// Run in browser console after entering email
console.log('Testing email link...');
// Check Network tab for Firebase API calls
```

## 📧 Expected Email Content

If you didn't request this, you can ignore this email.
```

## 🎯 Most Likely Solution

**Quick Fix:**
1. Enable Email Link provider in Firebase Console
