# Passwordless Email Link Authentication

I've successfully integrated passwordless email link authentication into your CodeCrafters application! This provides a secure, modern authentication method without passwords.

## ✅ New Authentication Features

### **1. Passwordless Sign-In**
- Users can sign in using only their email address
- No password required - just click a secure link sent to their email
- Perfect for users who forget passwords or prefer passwordless authentication

### **2. Enhanced Security**
- Email links are time-limited and single-use
- Links can only be used on the same domain
- Automatic cleanup of stored email addresses after successful sign-in

### **3. Cross-Device Support**
- Links work across different devices
- Secure handling when users open links on different devices

## 🎯 How It Works

### **For Users:**
1. **Click "Sign in with email link (passwordless)"**
2. **Enter email address**
3. **Check email for sign-in link**
4. **Click the link to sign in automatically**

### **Technical Flow:**
1. User enters email → `sendSignInLinkToEmail()` called
2. Firebase sends secure link to user's email
3. User clicks link → `signInWithEmailLink()` completes authentication
4. User is automatically signed in and redirected

## 🔧 Firebase Console Setup

To enable passwordless authentication:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. **Select project**: tech-innov-48b2c
3. **Go to Authentication** → **Sign-in method**
4. **Click on Email/Password provider**
5. **Enable "Email link (passwordless sign-in)"**
6. **Add your domain**: `localhost` (for development)
7. **Click Save**

## 🚀 Available Authentication Methods

Your CodeCrafters app now supports **4 authentication methods**:

### **1. Email/Password Sign-In**
